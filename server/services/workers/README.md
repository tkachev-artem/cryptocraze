# CryptoCraze Automatic TP/SL Worker System

A comprehensive, production-ready worker system for automatic Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) execution in the CryptoCraze trading simulator.

## Overview

The worker system monitors open orders with TP/SL levels set and automatically closes them when price conditions are met. Built with BullMQ for reliable job queue management and Redis for distributed coordination.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Queue Manager** (`queueManager.ts`)
   - BullMQ-based job queue orchestration
   - Order monitoring job management
   - Dead letter queue for failed orders
   - Health monitoring and statistics

2. **Order Monitor Worker** (`orderMonitorWorker.ts`)  
   - Main worker processing TP/SL jobs
   - Real-time price condition checking
   - Automatic order closure execution
   - Performance metrics and error handling

3. **Price Monitor Service** (`priceMonitorService.ts`)
   - Real-time price feed integration
   - Price alert management
   - Symbol tracking and monitoring
   - Performance statistics

4. **Order Closure Service** (`orderClosureService.ts`)
   - Handles order closure transactions
   - P&L calculation and validation
   - User balance updates
   - Notification dispatch

5. **Worker Manager** (`workerManager.ts`)
   - Central orchestrator for all components
   - System health monitoring
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Component integration

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DB=0

# Worker Configuration
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=5          # Number of concurrent workers
STATIC_ONLY=false            # Disable workers in static mode
```

### Queue Settings

- **Job Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Processing Interval**: 2 seconds per order check
- **Max Order Monitoring**: 24 hours per order
- **Dead Letter Retention**: 500 completed, 200 failed jobs
- **Queue Cleanup**: 100 completed, 50 failed jobs retained

## Integration

### With Existing Services

The worker system integrates seamlessly with:

- **dealsService**: Automatic order monitoring on creation
- **unifiedPriceService**: Real-time price feed integration  
- **notifications**: User alerts on order closure
- **storage**: Balance and statistics updates

### Database Schema

Uses existing `deals` table with fields:
- `takeProfit`: TP level (optional)
- `stopLoss`: SL level (optional) 
- `status`: Order status tracking
- `closedAt`: Closure timestamp
- `closePrice`: Final execution price
- `profit`: Calculated P&L

## API Endpoints

### Admin Monitoring

All endpoints require admin authentication:

- `GET /api/admin/workers/health` - System health status
- `GET /api/admin/workers/stats` - Detailed statistics  
- `GET /api/admin/workers/queues` - Queue information
- `GET /api/admin/workers/prices` - Price monitoring status
- `GET /api/admin/workers/closures` - Closure statistics
- `POST /api/admin/workers/restart` - Restart worker system
- `POST /api/admin/workers/shutdown` - Graceful shutdown
- `POST /api/admin/workers/emergency-stop` - Emergency stop
- `GET /api/admin/workers/jobs/:dealId` - Job details
- `DELETE /api/admin/workers/jobs/:dealId` - Remove job
- `GET /api/admin/workers/metrics/export` - Export metrics
- `GET /api/admin/workers/monitor/stream` - Real-time monitoring

### Health Check Integration

The main health endpoint (`/health`) includes worker system status:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "workers": {
    "isHealthy": true,
    "status": "healthy", 
    "uptime": 3600000,
    "components": {
      "queueManager": { "isHealthy": true },
      "priceMonitor": { "isHealthy": true },
      "orderClosure": { "isHealthy": true },
      "orderWorker": { "isHealthy": true }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Automatic Integration

Orders with TP/SL levels are automatically added to monitoring:

```typescript
// In dealsService.openDeal()
if (takeProfit || stopLoss) {
  await workerManager.addOrderToMonitoring({
    dealId: deal.id,
    userId,
    symbol,
    direction,
    amount,
    multiplier, 
    openPrice,
    takeProfit,
    stopLoss,
    openedAt: now,
  });
}
```

### Manual Management

```typescript
import { workerManager } from './services/workers';

// Add order to monitoring
await workerManager.addOrderToMonitoring(orderData);

// Remove from monitoring
await workerManager.removeOrderFromMonitoring(dealId);

// Check system health
const health = await workerManager.getSystemHealth();
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Order Processing**: Active orders, completion rates
- **Price Monitoring**: Update latency, tracked symbols
- **System Performance**: Processing times, error rates
- **Queue Health**: Job counts, failure rates

### Real-time Monitoring

Use the admin endpoints or Server-Sent Events stream for real-time monitoring:

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/admin/workers/monitor/stream');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Worker update:', data);
};
```

## Production Deployment

   - Load balancing
   - Regional distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Orders Not Being Monitored**

- Check price feed connectivity
- Verify database connections

**Performance Issues**
- Adjust worker concurrency

### Adding Features

1. Extend worker interfaces in `queueManager.ts`
2. Implement processing logic in worker files
